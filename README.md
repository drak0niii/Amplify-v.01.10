# Amplify-v.01.10

This project aims to create an intelligent chatbot that can understand and process audio input from users, converting it into text and providing meaningful responses. The chatbot is designed to be highly vertile and able to handle a wide range of tasks and languages, making it an excellent tool for businesses, educators, and individuals alike.
Amplify provides an innovative solution for communication and collaboration, making it an invaluable tool for a wide range of applications.

This project is composed of two parts: a client-side React application and a server-side Node.js application.

## Features

   - Audio Transcription: The chatbot uses advanced speech recognition technology to transcribe audio from recordings into text, allowing users to interact with the chatbot using voice commands.
   - Multilingual Support: The chatbot is capable of understanding and processing multiple languages, breaking down language barriers and enabling seamless communication between users from different linguistic backgrounds.
   - Script Triggering: The chatbot can trigger scripts based on user input, allowing it to integrate with other systems and services, automate tasks, and provide dynamic responses to user queries.
   - Real-time Output Display: The chatbot displays its output in the chat room, making it easy for users to follow the conversation and access the information they need.
   - Intelligent Conversations: Powered by OpenAI's GPT 3.5, the chatbot is capable of providing relevant, context-aware responses, enabling natural and engaging conversations with users.


## Getting Started

- body-parser
- cors
- dotenv
- express
- helmet
- morgan
- openai

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/drak0niii/Amplify.git
2. Change to the project directory:
cd your-repo

#### Client-side

3. Change to the client directory:
cd client
4. Install client dependencies:
npm install
5. Start the development server:
npm run dev

The client application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Server-side

6. Change to the server directory:
[cd ..], 
[mkdir server],
[cd ../server],
7. Install server dependencies:
npm init -y
8. Start the development server:
npm run dev

The server application should now be running and listening for requests.

## Deployment

Build the client-side application for production by running the following command in the client directory:
npm run build


Here's the info showing the installation commands for the client-side and server-side dependencies:
1.  npm create vite@latest
  - project name client 
  - select a framework: React
  - select a variant: JavaScript
 
2. Follow steps from Client-side
3. For the client-side:
npm install @heroicons/react @reduxjs/toolkit dotenv react react-chat-engine-advanced react-dom react-dropzone react-redux react-router-dom -D sass 

4. Folow steps from Server-side
5. For the server-side:
npm install axios body-parser cors dotenv express helmet morgan openai
